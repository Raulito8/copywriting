The Sea is <mark>abandoning</mark> you! 



This very world we live on may not look the same the next 5 years.



When we watch movies, we see many vibrant colors



Colors we may never see again outside outside our windows.



That’s why in this email I will show you ways you can experience 

our world before it all goes gray.



Biking
Going out for a stroll doesn’t mean an intense exercise or anything 

dangerous. It could just be to enjoy the scenery with pleasure. Plus 

it doesn’t destroy the environment!

Fishing

Grabbing some lunch outside patiently takes some stress out of life. 

As you wait you observe millions of years of earth resting in 

front of you.

Swimming

Swimming could feel like flying if you thought about it. Especially 

in a wide open area.



<mark>It’s that last one I want to talk about. </mark>



You see, the world may look nice now, but it’s constantly changing.



Our oceans are changing.



Within 10 years, our oceans will get so polluted that beaches might 

close permanently from constant problems. 



Scuba diving seems be your last chance at this point.



But wait, you probably don’t know how to scuba dive!



That’s where this email comes in.



 Here at [business name] We will provide you with FREE scuba diving
 
 instructor lesson in the link below.



 [business name] is meant to be the last chance at seeing 
 
 our clear waters.

Key points: see the ocean before it’s 
destroyed and here’s how to see it clearer.
